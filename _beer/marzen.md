name: Schlenkerla Rauchbier
description: It seems this one has a bit of fame. The “real Schlenkerla smoked beer” certainly doesn’t disappoint. It’s how I’d imagine kissing an ashtray. The smokiness comes through immediately and throughout and – if I dare to say – overpowers much of the remaining beer taste. Not sure I’ll be back to this one in a hurry. The novelty wore off quickly, and it wasn’t the most pleasant to drink. Still, good as a reminder of some of the more extreme flavours out there.
