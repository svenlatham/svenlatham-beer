name: La Trappe Puur
description: a weaker beer with a weird taste, almost hoppy in the way alcohol-free beers taste. Lingering sweet taste. Beer itself smells a little burnt. Taste is creamy and fizzy. Aftertaste lingers for a while. Nothing special but a good option for "don't want to have too much".
strength: 4.7%
