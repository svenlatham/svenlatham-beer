name: Hercule Stout
description: Named after the Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, this has been on my to try list for a while. It’s a decent stout with a nice, dark flavour. Reminds me of chocolate, coffee bitterness which works well. Slightly stronger at 9% ABV. I’d certainly be happy to add this to the regular rotation when it becomes available.
strength: 9.0%
