name: Westvleteren
description: Very difficult to get hold of (you shouldn't see this for resale - it's supposed to be bought direct from the abbey). Refined, strong, The 8 degrees bottle is a nice, strong dark taste but surprisingly not too fizzy. Hints of chocolate aftertaste. Nice all rounder but it's not "amazing" as the exclusivity might suggest! 10 is pretty well as expected, a darker, stronger beer with a tiny bit more fizz.
